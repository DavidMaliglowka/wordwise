		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Firebase Project and Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into setting up the Firebase project, enabling Authentication, creating Firestore collections (User, BrandProfile, Document, Suggestion, MetricSnapshot), configuring Firebase Storage, and writing basic security rules to enforce HTTPS and restrict access to authenticated users.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct Firebase service configurations and security rule setups, requiring coordination among several subtopics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows using Firebase Auth in a React application. Include tasks for UI component development, integration with Firebase Auth methods, and state management through Zustand or React Context.",
			"reasoning": "Although standard, this task involves integration and state management in the frontend, with dependency on Firebase configuration established earlier."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Document CRUD Backend Functions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand on creating Firebase Cloud Functions for document CRUD operations, including tasks for create, read, update, and delete endpoints, integration with Firestore and Firebase Admin SDK, and enforcement of security based on user authentication.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires backend function development with proper security checks, error handling, and validations for CRUD operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Documents Dashboard UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the subtasks for building the Documents Dashboard UI, including creating the global sidebar, content header with action buttons, document grid gallery, and implementing infinite scroll/pagination. Include tasks for responsiveness and integration with backend data fetching.",
			"reasoning": "Building a comprehensive dashboard involves complex UI layout design, state management and fetching data, along with responsive design and user interaction considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Rich-Text Editor Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps required to integrate a rich-text editor (either Lexical or Tiptap) into the React application. Include tasks for selecting the editor, setting up basic content editing capabilities, configuring the toolbar with formatting options, and managing editor state.",
			"reasoning": "Integration of a rich-text editor is moderately complex, requiring careful configuration, state management, and adherence to UX best practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Grammar/Spell Check AI Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task by breaking it into subtasks for creating a Cloud Function that leverages the OpenAI GPT-4o model for grammar and spell checking, engineering the appropriate prompt, handling streaming responses, and implementing edge caching based on a text hash.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating AI with GPT-4, handling streaming responses, and caching adds significant complexity, including error handling and latency considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-time Grammar/Spell Suggestions in Editor",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks covering: integration of the grammar API with debounced input handling, parsing and categorizing suggestion data, building the right sidebar UI for grouped suggestions, implementing custom text highlighting within the editor, and developing interactive hover cards with accessibility features.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves deep integration of real-time API calls, sophisticated UI changes for both the editor and sidebar, error handling, and ensuring keyboard accessibility, making it highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Live Metrics Panel",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into designing the UI components, developing algorithms for real-time word count, reading time, and Flesch-Kincaid grade calculations, and integrating the metrics logic with the live editor updates.",
			"reasoning": "While the task requires real-time calculations and precise UI placement, the scope is more straightforward compared to deep integrations, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Passive Voice Detection AI Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into defining technical architecture and requirements, crafting a detailed GPT-4o prompt for passive voice detection, implementing the Cloud Function for processing and formatting responses, and integrating a caching mechanism similar to the grammar endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "Developing an AI endpoint with precise prompt engineering, cloud function implementation, and integration of caching adds moderate to high complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Passive Voice Suggestions in Editor",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split this task into analyzing and documenting current editor integration points, extending the suggestion logic to include passive voice detection, implementing distinct visual highlighting for passive suggestions, and developing hover cards with keyboard navigation for accessibility.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires synchronizing new passive voice features with existing grammar integration, while maintaining UI consistency and accessibility standards, which increases its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Personal Dictionary",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into updating Firestore user documents, creating Cloud Functions for CRUD operations on dictionary terms, designing the UI for dictionary management, and integrating dictionary check logic into existing grammar and passive voice endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "Adding both backend and frontend components, along with integration into existing systems to filter suggestions based on user preferences, contributes to a moderate level of complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task by setting up the workflow file structure, configuring separate jobs for linting, building, and testing, defining trigger events and caching strategies, and verifying that the CI/CD pipeline functions correctly through test runs.",
			"reasoning": "While the CI/CD pipeline requires careful configuration, it follows established procedures and best practices, making it a moderately straightforward but essential task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Grammar Checker Performance",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this task into subtasks that include: implementing a client-side baseline grammar engine with unified/retext/nspell, fixing Unicode and error position mapping, overhauling the caching mechanism, resolving race conditions and infinite loops, adding multi-language support and confidence tuning, developing a hybrid routing decision engine for dynamic model usage, integrating Web Workers and text chunking for performance, and performing comprehensive testing across the system.",
			"reasoning": "This overhaul affects multiple layers of the system—from client-side processing to advanced backend logic—and involves complex performance optimizations, concurrency controls, and cross-module integrations, thus rating the highest in complexity."
