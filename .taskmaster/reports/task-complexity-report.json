			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Firebase Project and Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into setting up the Firebase project, enabling Authentication, creating Firestore collections (User, BrandProfile, Document, Suggestion, MetricSnapshot), configuring Firebase Storage, and writing basic security rules to enforce HTTPS and restrict access to authenticated users.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct Firebase service configurations and security rule setups, requiring coordination among several subtopics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows using Firebase Auth in a React application. Include tasks for UI component development, integration with Firebase Auth methods, and state management through Zustand or React Context.",
			"reasoning": "Although standard, this task involves integration and state management in the frontend, with dependency on Firebase configuration established earlier."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Document CRUD Backend Functions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand on creating Firebase Cloud Functions for document CRUD operations, including tasks for create, read, update, and delete endpoints, integration with Firestore and Firebase Admin SDK, and enforcement of security based on user authentication.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires backend function development with proper security checks, error handling, and validations for CRUD operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Documents Dashboard UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the subtasks for building the Documents Dashboard UI, including creating the global sidebar, content header with action buttons, document grid gallery, and implementing infinite scroll/pagination. Include tasks for responsiveness and integration with backend data fetching.",
			"reasoning": "Building a comprehensive dashboard involves complex UI layout design, state management and fetching data, along with responsive design and user interaction considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Rich-Text Editor Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps required to integrate a rich-text editor (either Lexical or Tiptap) into the React application. Include tasks for selecting the editor, setting up basic content editing capabilities, configuring the toolbar with formatting options, and managing editor state.",
			"reasoning": "Integration of a rich-text editor is moderately complex, requiring careful configuration, state management, and adherence to UX best practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Grammar/Spell Check AI Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task by breaking it into subtasks for creating a Cloud Function that leverages the OpenAI GPT-4o model for grammar and spell checking, engineering the appropriate prompt, handling streaming responses, and implementing edge caching based on a text hash.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating AI with GPT-4, handling streaming responses, and caching adds significant complexity, including error handling and latency considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-time Grammar/Spell Suggestions in Editor",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for integrating real-time grammar and spell suggestions into the rich-text editor. Include tasks for debouncing user input, calling the AI endpoint, parsing suggestions, and implementing custom marks and hover cards with keyboard accessibility.",
			"reasoning": "This integration builds on complex backend services and requires real-time UI updates with dynamic highlights and interactive components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Live Metrics Panel",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "List the subtasks for developing the Live Metrics Panel, including designing the UI in the right sidebar, implementing logic to calculate word count, estimated reading time, and Flesch-Kincaid grade in real-time, and ensuring proper layout positioning for the footer.",
			"reasoning": "While the calculations and UI updates are straightforward, real-time updating adds a moderate level of complexity in ensuring accuracy and responsiveness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Passive Voice Detection AI Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task by identifying steps for developing a Cloud Function that detects passive voice using GPT-4o, crafting a prompt specific to passive voice detection, implementing structured response formatting and integrating caching mechanisms similar to the grammar check endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "This task is similar to the grammar check endpoint but requires distinct prompt engineering and response handling for passive voice, increasing its overall complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Passive Voice Suggestions in Editor",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the tasks for integrating passive voice suggestions into the rich-text editor, including extending existing logic to handle passive voice responses, applying distinct highlighting, and implementing hover cards and keyboard navigation for user interaction.",
			"reasoning": "This task extends existing editor integrations with another layer of suggestion handling, requiring careful design to ensure both grammar/spell and passive voice suggestions function seamlessly together."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Personal Dictionary",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps required to implement a personal dictionary, including updating Firestore user documents to include dictionary fields, creating Cloud Functions for CRUD operations on dictionary terms, building the UI for dictionary management, and integrating dictionary check logic into grammar and passive voice endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves backend modifications, frontend UI design, and integration with AI endpoints to filter suggestions, all of which add a moderate level of complexity."
